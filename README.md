# Iris Flower Machine Learning

## The Iris flower data set- consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.

### Plot and visualize the data using Scikit-learn (Sklearn) library, the most useful and robust library for machine learning in python.

### Building model:
#### Splitting the dataset into: x-dependent variables, y-independent variable
#### Splitting our dataset into train-80% of data and test-20% of data 

### Using two algorithms to Classify the flowers:
#### First Algorithm K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
#### Second algorithm Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)


#### contain 2 files of python and ipynb

#### Written with Google Colab that provides a jupyter notebook to run code without installing any software or libraries in your local machine.
